# Music Library

This repository contains an app that I built as a project for Command Shift bootcamp. It connects to a database and allows the user to create, read, update and delete data relating to artists and albums.

This app was created using the NPX script `@command-shift/create-backend-app`.

## Getting started

### Set up the database

- Install Docker.
- Pull and run a postgres image to create a container.
- Install pgAdmin.
- Add a new server.

### Clone this repository

- Create a fork of this repo.
- Copy the fork's git address and clone to you machine using `git clone`.

### Install the project dependencies

Use `npm install` to download the project's dependencies.

### Store your environment variables

- Check the `.env.example` file to see what should be included.
- Create your own `.env` file.
- Enter your database's credentials.
- Create a `.env.test` file to create a separate database for testing.
- Re-enter the credentials but assign a different name to `PGDATABASE`.
- Check both files are in the `.gitignore` file so they can't be shared.

## Run the test code

Use `npm test` to run the integration tests.

## Use Postman to interact with the database

- Use `npm start` to start your server.
- Open Postman and enter http://localhost:3000.
- See the table below for routes and methods for each operation.
- When using routes that contain `:id`, you will need to replace this with the artist's or album's ID.
- If you want to add an album to the database, you will need to add the artist first.
- For POST and PUT requests, you will need to add information to the request body. Select `Body` and `raw`, then select JSON from the dropdown.
- POST and PUT requests for artists will need `name` and `genre` data e.g.

```
{
  "name": "test",
  "genre": "test"
}
```

- POST and PUT requests for albums will need `name`, `year` and `artistId` data e.g.

```
{
  "name": "test",
  "year": 2023,
  "artistId": 1
}
```
